Since i dont want you guys to get confused or worried, 
I thought it would be a good idea to give you a demonstration of 
how react works, how to manipulate the html structure and css through react, etc.

Now the first thing to note is that outside of importing google fonts you'll likely not have to touch the index.html file.

Second, I went ahead and installed 'react-router' for the project so I can demo how to make a website page etc.

in the App.js file you'll notice I'm returning  a BroswerRouter with a Routes class that has several Route children. 

on line 24 I give an example of how you could create a route and html directly to the route

 whereas on line 34 I give an example of how you can create a class instead to provide the same functionality but in a cleaner format.

 There are better ways to structure the routes to create a sort of tree format but i think we should probably look at that together!
